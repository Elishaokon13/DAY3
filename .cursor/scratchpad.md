# ETH Buying AI Agent Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation
The goal is to create an AI agent that helps users buy ETH directly within a dApp, with a focus on making blockchain technology accessible to Web2 users. The agent will abstract away blockchain complexity and allow users to purchase ETH using familiar payment methods like Opay, making the experience as simple as using any other payment app.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **User Experience**
   - Abstract blockchain complexity
   - Familiar payment flow for Web2 users
   - Clear transaction status and feedback
   - Simple, intuitive interface

2. **Payment Integration**
   - Opay API integration
   - Multiple payment method support
   - Secure payment processing
   - Transaction verification

3. **AI Assistance**
   - Natural language interaction
   - Transaction guidance
   - Price analysis and suggestions
   - User education without technical jargon

4. **Technical Requirements**
   - Payment gateway integration
   - Web3 backend for ETH distribution
   - Real-time price feeds
   - Transaction monitoring
   - AI model for user assistance
